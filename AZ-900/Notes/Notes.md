Benefits of using cloud services
- High availability: Azure SLAs guarantee an extremely high service uptime, >99.9%.
- High scalability: Quickly able to adjust resources to meet demand. Cloud is a consumption-based model and you pay for what you need. Vertical Scaling (adjusting capabilities / power of resources) and Horizontal Scaling (adjusting number of resouces) are easy.
- High Reliability: Due to the cloud's decentralized nature, you can quickly deploy resouces around the world and adjust based on disasters or other events.
- Manageable Security & Governance: Easily configure and update policies to ensure deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.
