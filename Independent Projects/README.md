# **Folder Contents**
This "Independent Projects" folder is partly chronological. The numbered folders are significant projects that directly relate to my career goals. They are numbered in order of when I completed that project, and consecutive projects will likely build upon previous ones (ex. Project 2 builds upon Project 1.)
The "Miscellaneous Projects" folder is full of fun side projects that may not necessarily directly relate to my career goals, but are still worth mentioning and documenting (oftentimes for my own use.)
