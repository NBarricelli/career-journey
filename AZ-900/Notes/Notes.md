**Benefits of using cloud services**
- High availability: Azure SLAs guarantee an extremely high service uptime, >99.9%.
- High scalability: Quickly able to adjust resources to meet demand. Cloud is a consumption-based model and you pay for what you need. Vertical Scaling (adjusting capabilities / power of resources) and Horizontal Scaling (adjusting number of resouces) are easy.
- High Reliability: Due to the cloud's decentralized nature, you can quickly deploy resouces around the world and adjust based on disasters or other events.
- Manageable Security & Governance: Easily configure and update policies to ensure deployed resources meet corporate standards and government regulatory requirements.

**Cloud Service Types**
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Most flexible. Cloud provider maintains the hardware, connectivity to the internet, and phyiscal security. User is responsible for everything else (OS install, network config, data config, etc.)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Middle ground. Cloud provider maintains hardware, connectivity, physical security, OS maintenance, middleware, and BI services. User maintains data config and sometimes applications and directory infra.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Most complete, essentially renting a fully developed app. Cloud provider maintains everything except data, accounts and identities, and sometimes identity infra.

**What is Azure?**
- Microsoft's collection of more than 100 cloud services. Allows you to do everything from running existing apps on VMs to exploring intelligent bots and mixed reality.

**Interacting with Azure**
- Web portal: portal.azure.com
- CLI: Started within the web portal. PowerShell and BASH can be used to interact with Azure.
        Note: when using PowerShell, the command *az interactive* can be used to make the CLI          more IDE-esque with autocompetion, command descriptions, and examples.
